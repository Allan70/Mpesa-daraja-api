# M-pesa API npm package

This is an npm package intended to streamline the process of adding the M-Pesa Daraja API to your project.
M-Pesa is like a digital wallet on your phone that lets you send and receive money, pay for things, and even borrow small amounts of money. It works through text messages and is used a lot in Africa.

You can use it without needing a bank account, and there are people called agents who help you turn cash into digital money and back again.
It's super handy because you can do all these things using just your phone, even if you don't have an internet connection.

The following package allows a developer to interact with M-Pesa's transaction API to allow Software to make mobile payments. The package only supports `NodeJS` for now. More updates are to be made.

You need to create an application at the [daraja API](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/) platform first before you can use the following package.

> Daraja API requires requests to be made from a secure HTTPS TLS connection.

We recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/guides/developer-preview/getting-started/) to achieve a TLS connection on your device.

For windows you can use

```sh
choco install ngrok

```

For mac OS

```sh
brew install ngrok

```

For Linux use APT

```sh
curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/ngrok.gpg && \
  echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/ngrok.gpg] https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list && \
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok

```

To check whether you have ngrok installed you can run the following command

```sh
ngrok -h

```

Ngrok uses an auth token, that requires it's CLI users to log into the `ngrok` platform. You must have an account on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

Run this command to add the authtoken to your terminal.

```sh
ngrok config add-authtoken TOKEN

```

## Starting the Ngrok package

```sh
ngrok http 8000

```

Now open the Forwarding URL in your browser and you should see your local web service. At first glance, it may not seem impressive, but there are a few key differences here:

That URL is available to anyone in the world. Seriously, test it out by sending it to a friend.
You are now using TLS (notice the ðŸ”’ in your browser window) with a valid certificate without making any changes to your local service.

## Installing daraja-package

Install the package into your project you can find the npm package here.
